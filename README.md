# Reinforcement Learning
- interaction between agent and environment
- action is chosen by agent based on state of environment
- environment changes and returns reward and new state

- state space: set of all possible states
- usefull vs. classification when not all information is present and novel way of solving problem is needed (edge-cases)

- agent uses algorithm (e.g. Q-Learning) to maximize reward

- actions: discrete vs. continuous action spaces
- action space: set of all possible actions
- discrete -> Q-Learning, continuous -> Actor-Cri????-Models
